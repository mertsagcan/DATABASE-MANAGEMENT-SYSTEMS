--This is the script I used for creating
CREATE RULE user1 LOGIN PASSWORD password;

After I switched to the user interface created I tried to query the cancelled orders and I got a n error message.

--This is the error message
SQL Error [42501]: ERROR: permission denied for table orders.

I got this error because the user I created does not have the permission to query.

To fix this, I had to switch back to the admin user to give permission to query the orders table to the newly created user.

--This is the query I used to give permission to the newly created user.
grant select on orders to user1

Then I switched back to new user and tried to query orders table again.

--This is the query I used to query cancelled orders
select  * from orders o
where o.status = 'CANCELLED'



This query executed successfully, I got all cancelled orders.
